| RSS | The construct of the metric assigns a different weight to the severity of the non-compliance as follows;<br>Cat1: 6<br>Major: 3<br>Minor: 1<br>So, a Cat1 non compliance is considered to be twice as severe as a Major and 6 times more severe than a Minor non compliance. These weights have been defined deterministically and can be altered if required in future development work. Essentially this produces a weighted average of the severity of the non compliance across the measures in a project, or any level of aggregation such as an individual installer, RC, RA etc.<br>The score is thenm normalised to a range of 0 to 100 by initially dividing by 6. If all the measures were a Cat1 then the total score would be 6, so dividing by 6 brings it in the range of 0 to 1. For easier use, the score is then multiplied by 100 to convert into a range from 0 to 100. | Metric | Cross-Domain | RSS = 100 x (((6 x sum Cat1 measures) + (3 x sum Major measures) + sum Minor measures)/sum measures audited)/6 | Data Ethics - TM - Data Driven Assurance v1.3 |
